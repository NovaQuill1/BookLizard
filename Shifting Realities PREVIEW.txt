---- Shifting Realities ----

The fire in the grate has burned low - nothing left but an orange hush that flickers over the mismatched teacups and saucers scattered across the table. Outside the windows, Chess is folded in midnight. A wind rattles the glass, but here in this half-warm room, it feels like the world has shrunk to just the two of us.

Jest is stretched across the armchair opposite of mine, boots kicked up, collar undone. He looks so beautifully wrong here - too golden, too alive for a place stitched together by shadows. His hat lies abandoned on the floor. His hair is a mess, his grin lazy, and I think, this is how I want to remember him. Not in court silk, just like this. 

I’m pouring another cup, although I don't really want one. I mostly just need something to do with my hands. My fingers tremble as I watch the swirling steam rise from the cup. 

“You know,” he says, suddenly- the words slurring at the edges like he’s half-asleep. “You’re… you’re truly a great friend, Hatta.”

A great friend.

The words drop between us like a card turned over. 

My throat closes. I swirl my spoon in the cup, metal clinking porcelain as I look anywhere but at Jest. 

Friend.

If only he knew. If only he knew the way my hands ache to touch his throat, his jaw, to feel his laugh rumble against my skin. The way I dream of him - always just out of reach, dancing through the chessboard shadows, his grin like a promise.

I could say something clever. A riddle. A joke. Anything to stop the moment from sinking its teeth into my chest.
Instead, I look up at him. He’s half-smiling at the ceiling now, like he’s talking to the stars instead of me. His eyes are lazy and half- closed, as if he’s already forgotten what he said. 

A clock on the mantel ticks out the seconds we’ll never get back.

“Is that so?” I say finally, my voice too soft. Too careful. I’m terrified of slipping up, terrified of speaking a single word of all the things that go on inside my head.  “A great friend?”

He shifts, drops his eyes to me - those sparkling amber eyes, so bright they hurt. “The best. Couldn’t ask for better.” He cracks a smile, his dimples reappearing. 

I force a grin - wide, wicked.  He’s always liked my madness more than my honesty.
“Well then,” I say, raising my cup, “to friendship.” I will my voice to be steady, although I feel as if I’m collapsing inside.

Our cups clink. The sound is hollow, like an echo when something is dropped down a well. He laughs. That laugh that feels like candlelight. He reaches across the table, ruffles my hair, too quick, too thoughtless, not knowing that every careless touch digs deeper.
When he leans back, my head feels cold. 

“You’re staring, Hatta.”

I snap my gaze to the fire. “Am I?”

He laughs again, this time quieter, like it’s for me alone. “You’re strange.”
You have no idea. 

He stands, stretching like a cat. “I should go before the Queen has my head.”
She can stand in line.

I clear my throat, straightening as I adjust the cravat tied too tightly around my neck. “Yes. Go.”
He pauses at the door, hat in hand. “You really are the best. Don’t know what I’d do without you.” He grins again, this time playful, like he’s hoping I’ll laugh. I don’t. 

And then he’s gone - the door clicks shut, the room swallows his warmth whole.
I’m alone with the cold tea and the clock’s relentless ticking. I lift my cup, toast the empty chair, and grin at the ghosts.

“A great friend,” I whisper. “A mad, mad fool I am.” 
The fire spits one last ember. I tip my hat over my eyes, grinning like a drunken fool. The teacup is dangling from my stiff fingers, and I slam it onto its saucer as the liquid sloshes in the cup. I pull my hat even further over my forehead, and slouch as much as possible until I practically slide under the table.  
“A great friend,” I repeat, my voice softer than it’s ever been. “A friend that is great or a great of a friend or a friend of a-”

“Hatta?” I jerk out of my thoughtless rambling, snapping my head up towards the door. A familiar figure stands in the doorway, silhouette dark against the dim candlelight. It’s Heather, her face twisted in confusion as she stares from across the table. Her vibrant gold dress matches the color of the melting candles lined along the table. The color of Jest’s eyes, I think to myself. 

“Hatta,” Heather repeats, louder this time. “What are you doing?” 
Why do you care?

I grunt, slowly sitting myself up and glance over to Heather.
Her hair is done up in complicated blonde swirls, and her dress doesn’t contain a single stain or wrinkle. She watches me with wide blue eyes, and I meet her gaze, uninterested. 

“Can a gentleman enjoy his late night tea?” I reply sullenly, letting my eyebrows lift to my forehead before standing up and sweeping my velvet coat off the floor. “If you'll excuse me, my lady, I shall better head off to bed before it gets any later.” I make my way to the doorway and try to brush past Heather, but she grabs my arm, her fingers too gentle, like she’s not forcing me to stay but is simply pleading. I sigh sharply, turning back to her. 

“Hatta,” she says softly, cocking her head to one side and bringing a hand to my shoulder. I shrink away and grip my coat tightly against my side. Now it was her turn to sigh, but she’s gazing into my eyes like it’s the last time she’ll ever see me. “Meet me in the gardens,” she whispers. “Tonight at midnight. I’ll be waiting for you in the courtyard.” I frown at her, my jaw clenched. 

“I don’t believe that would be appropriate. Secret meetings are never acceptable here. Now, if you would please excuse me, I’m off to bed.” I coldly shoulder past her and stalk down the hall. I can still feel Heather’s eyes on me, her gaze longing and heartbroken. 

Let her be heartbroken. I think to myself. There’s plenty of other men in this castle for her, and she’ll forget me as soon as she gets the chance. 

Plenty of other men. But not Jest. Never Jest. Nobody could ever be good enough to deserve him.
